Description: NanoMethViz is a toolkit for visualising methylation data from 
    Oxford Nanopore sequencing. It can be used to explore methylation patterns
    from reads derived from Oxford Nanopore direct DNA sequencing with
    methylation called by callers including nanopolish, f5c and megalodon. The
    plots in this package allow the visualisation of methylation profiles
    aggregated over experimental groups and across classes of genomic features.
