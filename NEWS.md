### Version 3.0.0
* Breaking change to smoothing strategy in plot_gene(), plot_region(), and plot_granges() to use weighted moving mean instead of loess. This deprecates the `span` argument in favour of `smoothing_window` which is defaulted to 2000 bases.
  * Smoothing for various plotting functions was previously performed using loess smoothing, this performed locally weighted linear estimation to create a smoothed line, the span argument controlled the proportion of data used in this smoothing. This was always a difficult parameter to tune because as you plot a larger region, the amount of data also increased. The consequence was that, under fixed span, the smoothed line would look different based on scale of the plotting region. Internally NanoMethViz utilised a dynamic span value which changed inversely proportional to the width of the plotting region, this decreased the span as the plotting region grew in order to prevent fine changes from being smoothed out. However the calculated span was invisible to users, and it was unclear how to set a span to change the appearance of the plot.
  * The change of the smoothing method to a weighted rolling means approach lead to the new `smoothing_window` argument which represents the window size in bases from which data is used for smoothing around each point. This serves the same purpose as the dynamic calculation done previously, but is set more explicitly and should be more intuitive for users. The default is always 2000, and can be increased to increase smoothness and decreased to decrease smoothness.
* Added plot_violin() function for creating violin plots for samples over specific regions.
* Added check to remove hard-clipped reads because they may not have matching mod strings.
* Changed gene annotation to always put label on visible isoforms, previously labels are plotted at the center of isoform.
* Fixed memory leak in bam parsing.
* Fixed crash when CIGAR doesn't match length of SEQ.

### Version 2.6.0
* Added preliminary modbam file support.
* Changed rug plot to appear under other geoms. This helps with visibility of data when methylation values are close to 0.
* Changed heatmap alpha from 0.5 to 1, line width from 1.0 to 1.2 and line colour from black to darkgrey.
* Changed x-axis limits on plots to be controlled using coord_cartesian instead of scale_x_continuous. Plots should now accurately represent data around the boundaries.

### Version 2.4.0
* Fixed `plot_region_heatmap()` producing the wrong plot when a factor is used for the chromosome.
* Fixed nanopolish and f5c import positions being off by 1.
* Fixed broken `samples()` setter for NanoMethResults.
* Added `plot_agg_genes()` function as a shorthand for `plot_agg_regions(x, exons_to_genes(exons(x)))`. 
* Added the ability to interrupt `methy_to_bsseq()` calls.
* Added handling for NanoMethResults objects in `filter_methy()`. If NanoMethResult is used as input, then NanoMethResult is invisibly returned as output.
* Added black outlines to exons in annotation to distinguish contiguous segments for features like tandem repeats.
* Added `line_size` argument to `plot_gene()`, `plot_region()` and `plot_granges()` plots for adjusting line size.
* Added `subsample` argument to heatmap plots, default 50. This reduces the number of rows shown the plot to the specified amount.
* Added `get_exons_mm10()`, `get_exons_hg19()`, and `get_exons_hg38()` as replacements for `get_exons_mus_musculus()` and `get_exons_homo_sapiens()`.
* Changed heatmaps to no longer plot samples that are absent from sample annotations.
* Changed heatmap labels to appear on the right rather than on top.
* Changed heatmap alpha from 0.33 to 0.5.
* Changed arrows in exon connectors to appear in the middle as open arrow instead of at the end as closed arrow.
* Changed default X axis labels to be rescaled to appropriate SI-style. e.g. Kb, Mb, Gb.

### Version 2.2.0
* Added `heatmap` argument to `plot_gene()`, `plot_region()` and `plot_granges()`. This adds a read-heatmap to the plot.
* Added `cluster_regions()` function to perform k-means clustering on a table of genomic regions based on methylation profile.
* Added median averaging method for trends in `plot_gene()`, `plot_region()` and `plot_granges()`. This can be changed using the new `avg_method` argument, default is `mean`.
* Added `filter_methy()` function to create a filtered methylation file.
* Added `region_methy_stats()` to obtain average methylation fractions of specific regions.
* Added `methy_to_edger()` direct conversion wrapper around `methy_to_bsseq()` and `bsseq_to_edger()`.
* Added `palette` argument to `plot_gene()`, `plot_region()` and `plot_granges()` to allow custom colour palettes.
* Fixed `bsseq_to_edger()` failing when regions argument was used.
* Fixed heatmaps not staying in a single column when more than 2 groups were present.

### Version 2.0.0
* Major changes to `plot_agg_regions()`.
  * Features of `plot_agg_regions()` and `plot_agg_regions_sample_grouped()` merged into one interface.
  * Regions now specified using single table.
* Changed `plot_regions()` default window proportion to 0.
* Changed default theme from `theme_bw()` to `theme_tufte()`.
* Added Megalodon data import instructions to "Importing Data" vignette.
* Added scico palette defaults for heatmaps. These are colourblind friendly.
* Added check for 0 length queries which would cause program to hang indefinitely.
* Added setters for NanoMethResult attributes `methy`, `samples` and `exons`.
* Added MDS and PCA plots.
* Added vignette for using external annotation and dimensionality reduction.
* Added binary thresholding for `plot_gene()`, `plot_region()` and `plot_agg_regions()`.
* Added regions argument to `bsseq_to_edger()` to calculate aggregate counts over features rather than per site.

### Version 1.1.4
* Added palette argument to aggregate plots
* Added `exons_to_genes()` function to convert exon annotation to gene annotation
* Added `plot_granges_heatmap()` function to use GRanges for plotting heatmaps

### Version 1.1.3

* Fixed group handling for list region input in `plot_agg_regions()`
* Fixed unused window size argument in `plot_region_heatmap()`
* Fixed error when reads overlap in name and position for internal function `StatLM()`

### Version 1.1.2

* Changed example dataset exon annotations from all genomic exons to just those contained in data.
* Fixed methylation heatmap to no longer be hard coded for Peg3.
* Added `plot_region_heatmap()` as analogue to `plot_region()`.
* Fixed `plot_agg_regions_sample_grouped()` to use `group` column of `NanoMethViz::samples(x)` rather than `haplotype`.
* Added unit tests.

### Version 1.1.1

* Added methylation heatmap via `plot_gene_heatmap()`.
* Fixed `gene_anno()` in `plot_gene()` for argument so FALSE actually turns off gene annotation.
* Added warning for cpp11 versions <0.2.5 which may cause memory crashes when trying to import methylation data.
* Added cpp11 version dependency to address tidyverse/readr#1145.
* Added query methylation by gene using `query_methy_gene()`.

### Version 1.0.0

* Initial Bioconductor release.
