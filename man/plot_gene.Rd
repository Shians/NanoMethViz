\arguments{
\item{x}{the NanoMethResult or ModBamResult object.}

\item{gene}{the gene symbol for the gene to plot.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}

\item{window_prop}{the size of flanking region to plot. Can be a vector of two
values for left and right window size. Values indicate proportion of gene
length.}

\item{anno_regions}{the data.frame of regions to be annotated.}

\item{binary_threshold}{the modification probability such that calls with
modification probability above the threshold are set to 1 and probabilities
equal to or below the threshold are set to 0.}

\item{avg_method}{the average method for pre-smoothing at each genomic position.
Data is pre-smoothed at each genomic position before the smoothed aggregate line
is generated for performance reasons. The default is "mean" which corresponds
to the average methylation fraction. The alternative "median" option is
closer to an average within the more common methylation state.}

\item{spaghetti}{whether or not individual reads should be shown.}

\item{heatmap}{whether or not read-methylation heatmap should be shown.}

\item{heatmap_subsample}{how many packed rows of reads to subsample to.}

\item{smoothing_window}{the window size for smoothing the trend line.}

\item{gene_anno}{whether to show gene annotation.}

\item{palette}{the ggplot colour palette used for groups.}

\item{line_size}{the size of the lines.}

\item{mod_scale}{the scale range for modification probabilities. Default c(0, 1), set to "auto" for automatic
limits.}

\item{span}{DEPRECATED, use smoothing_window instead. Will be removed in next version.}
}
\value{
a patchwork plot containing the methylation profile in the specified
region.
}
\description{
Plot the methylation of a gene symbol specified within the exon(x) slot.
}
\details{
This function plots the methylation data for a given gene. Since
V3.0.0 NanoMethViz has changed the smoothing strategy from a loess smoothing
to a weighted moving average. This is because the loess smoothing was too
computationally expensive for large datasets and had a span parameter that
was difficult to tune. The new smoothing strategy is controlled by the
smoothing_window argument.
