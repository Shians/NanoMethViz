\arguments{
\item{x}{the NanoMethResult object.}

\item{grange}{the GRanges object with one entry.}

\item{anno_regions}{the data.frame of regions to be annotated.}

\item{binary_threshold}{the modification probability such that calls with
modification probability above the threshold are set to 1 and probabilities
equalt to or below the threshold are set to 0.}

\item{avg_method}{the average method for pre-smoothing at each genomic position.
Data is pre-smoothed at each genomic position before the smoothed aggregate line
is generated for performance reasons. The default is "median" which produces
a smoothed line more robust to outliers, "mean" is the old default and tends
to produce lines with values dampened towards 0.5.}

\item{spaghetti}{whether or not individual reads should be shown.}

\item{heatmap}{whether or not read-methylation heatmap should be shown.}

\item{span}{the span for loess smoothing.}

\item{window_prop}{the size of flanking region to plot. Can be a vector of two
values for left and right window size. Values indicate proportion of gene
length.}
}
\value{

region.
